# Calculate the binary representation of some integer number.
#   The program prompts for an integer number and prints out its binary
#   representation, using the Python syntax rules. The behavior of the
#   program is undefined if no integer number is entered.
#   This version calculates the binary representation from left to right
#   (i.e., starting with the mist significant digit)
#

# examples:
#   18 : 0B10010
#    0 : 0B
#  -31 : -0B11111
