# in decimal format.
#   The program keeps on prompting for a non-negative
#   integer number until it finally gets one.

#! consists of digits. This means that negative numbers
#! and decimal numbers are not accepted.
#! isdigit is a method applicable to strings. The invocation
#! str.isdigit(number) could just as well be written
#! as number.isdigit()
